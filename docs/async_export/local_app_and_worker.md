# Test async export locally (app + Huey worker)

Run the Flask app and Huey worker as separate processes with the SQLite
backend — the same code path as production, without Nginx or systemd.

Both terminals need the same environment:

```bash
export SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key
export HUEY_BACKEND=sqlite
export HUEY_SQLITE_PATH=./instance/huey.db
export ALERTS_DB_PATH=../_broker_db/ztf_alerts_stream.db
export USERS_DB_PATH=../_broker_db/users.db
```

**Database:** `users.db` is created from `tools/usersdb_schema.sql` — the app
never alters the database itself. If your dev `users.db` predates a schema
change (e.g. `export_task.snapshot_mjd`), either recreate it:

```bash
sqlite3 ../_broker_db/users.db < tools/usersdb_schema.sql
```

or, if it holds data worth keeping (accounts, watchlists), alter it in place
with the matching one-shot script in `tools/`
(`apply_export_snapshot_mjd.sql`).

**Terminal 1 — app**

```bash
python -m flask --app wsgi:app run
```

**Terminal 2 — worker** (target `poi_broker.worker.huey`, not `extensions.huey`)

```bash
python -m huey.bin.huey_consumer poi_broker.worker.huey --workers=2 --worker-type=thread --verbose
```

Log in, go to `/export`, build a query, click **Start Export**. The page should return immediately. The worker should log:

```
EXECUTING: poi_broker.tasks.create_export_file
```

The page then shows **Export Completed** with a download link.

Confirm the shared queue DB exists and has tables:

```bash
ls -la ./instance/huey.db
sqlite3 ./instance/huey.db .tables
```

## Stuck export after killing the app (memory backend)

Default `HUEY_BACKEND=memory` has no consumer, so periodic cleanup never runs.
A Ctrl+C during `POST /export` leaves a `PENDING`/`RUNNING` row that 409s
retries. Age-aware `POST /export` only frees rows past
`EXPORT_STALE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` (default 30 minutes), so a just-interrupted
export still needs an immediate unstick.

Unstick with the **same environment** as the app (same `USERS_DB_PATH`):

```bash
python -m flask --app wsgi:app fail-stale-exports --force
```

`--force` fails every `PENDING`/`RUNNING` row now (aborts in-flight exports).
Without `--force`, only rows older than `EXPORT_STALE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`
(default 30 minutes) are failed.

Do not put this in `tools/`: that directory has its own `.env` and would
point at the wrong `users.db`.
