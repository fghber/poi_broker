# Add the Huey export worker on an existing Ubuntu site

This guide is for a **Linux production site that is already fully configured**
(Ubuntu 24.04+, Python + venv + Nginx + Gunicorn already running the POI Broker
web app). **Only the Huey/export feature is new.**

Nginx does not change. The existing web systemd unit does not change, except
for two new environment variables. The only new process is the Huey consumer,
supervised by systemd (`Restart=always`).

Why Huey + SQLite (not Celery/Redis): `docs/async_export/adr_huey_sqlite.md`.
Local check (app + worker, no systemd): `docs/async_export/local_app_and_worker.md`.

```

- **Gunicorn:** existing workers import the shared Huey instance and enqueue
  jobs onto **one** SQLite queue (`HUEY_SQLITE_PATH`).
- **Huey consumer (NEW):** a separate long-running process. systemd
  `Restart=always` restarts it if it exits.
- **ExportTask (NEW):** rows in `users.db` track PENDING → RUNNING →
  SUCCESS/FAILED. The stale-task guard fails stuck tasks after 30 minutes so a
  dead worker cannot permanently block a user’s export slot.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Production value | Where |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| `HUEY_BACKEND` | `sqlite` | web env **and** `huey.env` |
| `HUEY_SQLITE_PATH` | absolute path, **identical** in both files | web env **and** `huey.env` |
| `HUEY_THREADS` | `2` (see sizing below) | `huey.env` only |
| `HUEY_LOGFILE` | e.g. `/var/log/poi_broker/huey.log` | `huey.env` only |
| `SECRET_KEY` | same as the web app | `huey.env` |
| `ALERTS_DB_PATH` | same as the web app | `huey.env` |
| `USERS_DB_PATH` | same as the web app | `huey.env` |

Optional (defaults are fine):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `EXPORT_STALE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` | `1800` (30 min) | Fail stuck PENDING/RUNNING exports |
| `EXPORT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `10` | Delete old CSV files and `ExportTask` rows |

`HUEY_IMMEDIATE` applies only to the in-memory **development** backend. Do not
set it in production.

`HUEY_SQLITE_PATH` must be an **absolute** path. If the worker has no Flask app
context and the path is unset, it raises instead of silently creating a second
empty queue.

The SQLite queue uses WAL (`journal_mode=wal`) in `poi_broker/huey_config.py`.

---

## 1. Update the code and dependencies

Pull the latest code and install `huey` (already in `requirements.txt`):

```bash
# use the existing app user, venv, and checkout path
git pull
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The alerts DB stays where it already is. There is no auto-migration: apply
`tools/usersdb_schema.sql` to `users.db` if `export_task` is missing. If the
table already exists without the one-active-task index, add it:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS uix_export_task_one_active_per_user
    ON export_task (user_id)
    WHERE status IN ('PENDING', 'RUNNING');
```

If that statement errors, two `PENDING`/`RUNNING` rows already exist for the
same user — fail or delete the extras, then retry the index.

## 2. Add Huey variables to the existing web env

Add these two lines to the **existing** EnvironmentFile that Gunicorn already
reads (do not replace that file):

```bash
HUEY_BACKEND=sqlite
HUEY_SQLITE_PATH=/var/lib/poi_broker/huey.db
```

Adjust the path to the same data directory the live app already uses.

## 3. Create `/etc/poi-broker/huey.env` (NEW)

The worker needs the same secrets and DB paths as the web app, plus worker-only
settings. Use the **same** `HUEY_SQLITE_PATH` as in the web env:

```bash
SECRET_KEY="<same as the web env>"
ALERTS_DB_PATH=/var/lib/poi_broker/ztf_alerts_stream.db
USERS_DB_PATH=/var/lib/poi_broker/users.db
HUEY_BACKEND=sqlite
HUEY_SQLITE_PATH=/var/lib/poi_broker/huey.db
HUEY_THREADS=2
HUEY_LOGFILE=/var/log/poi_broker/huey.log
```

```bash
sudo chown root:<web-app-user> /etc/poi-broker/huey.env
sudo chmod 640 /etc/poi-broker/huey.env
```

## 4. Install the Huey systemd unit (NEW)

`docs/async_export/poi-broker-huey.service` is a template. Edit `User`, `Group`,
`WorkingDirectory`, `EnvironmentFile`, `ExecStart`, and `ReadWritePaths` so they
match the existing web service (same user, same venv, same data/log dirs).

The consumer **must** target `poi_broker.worker.huey`, not
`poi_broker.extensions.huey`. `worker.py` imports `poi_broker.tasks`, which
registers `create_export_file`. A worker started against `extensions.huey` runs
but never executes any task.

```bash
sudo cp docs/async_export/poi-broker-huey.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now poi-broker-huey
```

Restart the **existing** web/Gunicorn unit so it picks up the new env vars
(use the real unit name on the server):

```bash
sudo systemctl restart <existing-web-unit>
```

Verify:

```bash
sudo systemctl status <existing-web-unit>
sudo systemctl status poi-broker-huey
tail -f /var/log/poi_broker/huey.log
```

### Worker sizing

One Huey consumer process with `HUEY_THREADS` threads. Independent of the
Gunicorn worker count.

- **1 consumer × 2 threads** is the default: two concurrent exports, no SQLite
  lock contention from multiple consumer processes.
- Raise `HUEY_THREADS` to 3–4 only if exports queue under concurrent users.
- Do **not** run a second `huey_consumer` for the same queue.

### Supervision

Two separate mechanisms, both already in this repo / on Ubuntu:

1. **systemd** (`Restart=always` in `poi-broker-huey.service`) restarts the
   consumer if it exits. That is the process-level stall protection.
2. **Stale-task guard** (application code) marks `PENDING`/`RUNNING` exports
   older than 30 minutes as `FAILED` — at web/worker startup and every 5
   minutes via `cleanup_stale_export_tasks`. That frees the user’s active-export
   slot. It does **not** restart the worker; a live consumer is still required
   to run new jobs.

## 5. Nginx — no change

The existing site already proxies `/export` to Gunicorn. Async export returns
immediately; no extra proxy timeout is required for job execution.

---

## 6. Verify the full flow

1. Open the site and log in.
2. Go to **/export**, build a query, click **Start Export**.
3. The page should return immediately.
4. Watch the worker:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/poi_broker/huey.log
# [..] EXECUTING: poi_broker.tasks.create_export_file
```

5. The page should show **Export Completed** with a download link.

```bash
# Task is registered (prints a task object, not None)
sudo -u <web-app-user> <venv>/bin/python -c \
  "from poi_broker.worker import huey; print(huey._registry.string_to_task('poi_broker.tasks.create_export_file'))"

ls -la /var/lib/poi_broker/huey.db
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Export stays PENDING forever
1. Is the worker running? `sudo systemctl status poi-broker-huey`
2. Worker log: `tail -f /var/log/poi_broker/huey.log`
3. `HUEY_BACKEND=sqlite` in **both** env files?
4. `HUEY_SQLITE_PATH` the **same absolute path** in both files?
5. Consumer target is `poi_broker.worker.huey`?

### "database is locked"
- Only **one** Huey consumer: `ps aux | grep huey_consumer`
- Stale locks: `rm "$HUEY_SQLITE_PATH"-shm "$HUEY_SQLITE_PATH"-wal`
- `sudo systemctl restart poi-broker-huey`

### Exports block the HTTP request
- `HUEY_BACKEND` is not `sqlite`, or `HUEY_IMMEDIATE=true` is set on the web
  process. Check the existing web env.

### Stale exports blocking a user
- The guard fails exports with no progress for 30 minutes (`EXPORT_STALE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`).
  A live worker heartbeats `updated_at` while writing and only commits status
  transitions from expected states, so a long healthy export is not false-failed
  and cannot flip a stale `FAILED` row back to `SUCCESS`.
  The user can retry once a live worker is running.
